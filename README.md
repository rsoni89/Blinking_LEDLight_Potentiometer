Bearcat Tech Innovators Prestents: Project that use a potentiometer, to read its value using one analog input of an Arduino board. 
Costimize the blink rate of the built-in LED accordingly, to the pitentiometer. The resistor's analog value is read as a voltage because this is how the analog inputs work.

Materials needed:
Arduino UNO R3

Breadboard

10k ohm Potentiometer or 
10K ohm photoresistor and 10K ohm resistor

Built-in LED on pin 13 or
220 ohms resistor and red LED Light 

Wires to connect
